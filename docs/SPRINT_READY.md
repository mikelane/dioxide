**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

**Key Steps:**
1. Create project (Table template)
2. Configure custom fields (Status, Type, Area, Sprint, Story Points)
3. Add issues #1-18 to project
4. Create 4 views (Sprint Board, v0.1 Checklist, v0.2 Backlog, All Issues)
5. Set up automation (auto-close, auto-add)
6. Invite team members
