# GitHub Project Setup Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Ready for Setup

---

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the GitHub Project board for rivet-di. The GitHub CLI and API have limited support for Projects v2, so the board must be created manually through the GitHub web interface.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Project

1. Go to https://github.com/mikelane/rivet-di
2. Click the **Projects** tab
3. Click **New project** button
4. Choose **Table** template (we'll add Board view later)
5. Name it: **Rivet DI Development**

## Step 2: Configure Project Fields

### Add Custom Fields

Click the **⋮** (more options) next to any column header, then **Settings**.

Add these custom fields:

#### 1. Status (Single select)
**Important:** GitHub automatically creates a Status field. Edit it to have these values:
- 📋 Backlog
- 🔍 Ready for BDD
- ✅ BDD Complete
- 🚧 In Development
- 👀 In Review
- 🧪 QA Validation
- 🚀 Ready to Deploy
- ✔️ Done

#### 2. Type (Single select)
**Note:** Use existing GitHub labels, but this provides better filtering.
- Feature
- Bug
- Story
- Task
- Docs
- Test
- Infrastructure

#### 3. Area (Single select)
- Core
- Lifecycle
- Rust
- Python
- Testing
- Docs
- Infrastructure

#### 4. Sprint (Single select)
- Sprint 1 (v0.1 - Weeks 1-2)
- Sprint 2 (v0.2 - Weeks 3-4)
- Sprint 3 (v0.2 - Weeks 5-6)
- Backlog

#### 5. Story Points (Number)
For estimation (optional for v0.1)
- 1 = <4 hours
- 2 = 4-8 hours
- 3 = 1-2 days
- 5 = 2-3 days
- 8 = 3-5 days

## Step 3: Add Issues to Project

1. In the project, click **+ Add item** (bottom of any column)
2. Type `#` to search for issues
3. Add all issues #1-18 to the project

**Or use the bulk import:**
1. Click **⋮** (more options) → **Settings**
2. Click **Manage access**
3. Scroll to **Danger zone** → **Import items**
4. Select repository: `mikelane/rivet-di`
5. Click **Import all open issues**

---

## Step 4: Configure Initial Status

Set the initial status for each issue:

### Backlog (Not yet started)
- #1, #2, #4, #5, #6 (v0.2 features)

### Ready for BDD (Needs BDD scenarios written)
- All v0.1 issues start here initially

### Priority Order (v0.1 Issues)

**High Priority (Week 1 - Days 1-2):**
1. #7 - CI/CD setup
2. #8 - ADR-001
3. #9 - ADR-002
4. #15 - pytest-bdd setup

**High Priority (Week 1 - Days 3-5):**
5. #10 - Container structure
6. #11 - Instance Provider
7. #12 - Class Provider
8. #13 - Factory Provider
9. #14 - Resolution
10. #3 - Duplicate prevention

**Medium Priority (Week 2):**

## Step 6: Configure Automation (Optional)

GitHub Projects supports automated workflows:

### Auto-close on PR merge
1. Go to **⋮** → **Settings** → **Workflows**
2. Enable: **Item closed** → when linked PR is closed
3. Set Status to: **✔️ Done**

### Auto-add new issues
1. Enable: **Auto-add to project**
2. Set filter: `is:open is:issue repo:mikelane/rivet-di`
3. Set initial Status: **📋 Backlog**

## Step 7: Project Workflow

### Issue Lifecycle

```

## Step 9: Team Notifications

Set up notifications for the team:

1. **Watch the repository:** Click **Watch** → **All Activity**
2. **Subscribe to project:** Click **⋮** → **Settings** → **Notifications**
3. **Configure issue mentions:** GitHub Settings → Notifications → Participating

---

## Step 10: Initial Sprint Setup

Before starting Sprint 1, ensure:

### Day 0 (Project Setup - Today)
- [ ] GitHub Project created and configured
- [ ] All issues added to project
- [ ] Issues prioritized and assigned to Sprint 1
- [ ] Team has access and notifications configured

### Day 1 (Sprint Start)
- [ ] Sprint kickoff meeting (review sprint plan)
- [ ] Assign issues to team members
- [ ] Move first issues to "Ready for BDD"
- [ ] Begin infrastructure work (#7, #8, #9, #15)

---

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Standup (Async)
Each team member updates their issues:
- Move current issue to appropriate status
- Add comment with progress update
- Flag any blockers

### Pull Request Workflow
1. Developer creates PR
2. Link PR to issue (use keywords: "Closes #10")
3. Issue automatically moves to "In Review"
4. Code Reviewer reviews within 24 hours
5. QA Engineer validates after approval
6. SRE/Platform merges when ready

### Issue Updates
- Update issue with progress comments daily
- Use checkboxes in issue description for sub-tasks
- Tag blockers with `status: blocked` label
- Close issue when fully complete (BDD passes, merged, documented)

---

## Metrics to Track

### Sprint Metrics (Update Weekly)
- **Velocity:** Story points completed per week
- **Burndown:** Issues remaining vs. time remaining
- **Cycle Time:** Average time from "Ready for BDD" to "Done"
- **Blockers:** Count and duration of blockers

### Quality Metrics (Continuous)
- **BDD Pass Rate:** Percentage of BDD scenarios passing
- **Code Coverage:** Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Review Time:** Average time for PR approval
- **Bug Count:** Number of bugs found in QA

### Project Health (Monthly)
- **Community Engagement:** Stars, forks, issues from community
- **Downloads:** PyPI download count
- **Contributors:** Number of active contributors
- **Documentation:** Pages of documentation written

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Keep the board updated:** Move issues promptly, don't let them stagnate
2. **Use comments liberally:** Document decisions and blockers in issue comments
3. **Link PRs to issues:** Use "Closes #X" in PR description for auto-linking
4. **Review often:** Check the Sprint Board daily to stay aligned
5. **Celebrate wins:** Mark issues as Done and celebrate progress
6. **Retrospect weekly:** What went well? What to improve?

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue not showing in project
- Check if issue is assigned to project (click "Projects" in issue sidebar)
- Verify project filters aren't excluding the issue
- Try refreshing the browser

### Can't move issue between columns
- Check if you have write access to the project
- Verify the Status field is configured correctly
- Try using the Status dropdown in the issue details

### Automation not working
- Check project settings → Workflows
- Verify the workflow is enabled
- Check if the trigger conditions are met
