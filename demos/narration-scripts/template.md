## Narration Script

Timing markers `[MM:SS]` indicate when each narration segment should align
with the terminal recording. Write narration in a natural, conversational
tone as if explaining to a colleague.

### Introduction

[00:00] Welcome to this dioxide demo. Today we'll look at BRIEF_DESCRIPTION.

[00:10] Let me start by showing you the problem we're solving.

### Setup

[00:15] Here's a typical Python project with DESCRIBE_SETUP.

```
# Commands the presenter will type in the terminal:
$ cd example-project
$ cat requirements.txt
```

[00:30] As you can see, EXPLAIN_WHAT_VIEWER_SEES.

### The Problem

[01:00] The challenge with the traditional approach is EXPLAIN_PROBLEM.

```
$ python traditional_approach.py
```

[01:15] Notice how POINT_OUT_ISSUE. This is exactly the kind of problem dioxide solves.

### The Solution

[01:30] Now let's see the same thing with dioxide.

```
$ python dioxide_approach.py
```

[01:45] With dioxide, EXPLAIN_IMPROVEMENT. The key difference is HIGHLIGHT_BENEFIT.

### Deep Dive

[02:00] Let me break down what's happening under the hood.

[02:15] EXPLAIN_MECHANISM. This is made possible by dioxide's Rust-backed container.

### Results

[02:45] Let's compare the results side by side.

```
$ python compare.py
```

[03:00] SUMMARIZE_RESULTS. That's a QUANTIFY_IMPROVEMENT improvement.

### Conclusion

[03:30] To recap, dioxide's FEATURE_NAME gives you BENEFIT_SUMMARY.

## Recording Notes

- Pause 2-3 seconds after each command to let output settle
- Keep terminal clean between sections (use `clear` if needed)
- Highlight key output with cursor movement if possible
- Speak at a measured pace, slightly slower than normal conversation
