## Overview

`dioxide` is a dependency injection framework for Python that combines:

- **Declarative Python API** - Simple decorators and type hints
- **Rust-backed performance** - Fast graph construction and resolution via PyO3
- **Type safety** - Full support for mypy and type checkers
- **Clean architecture** - Encourages loose coupling and testability

## Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - Currently implementing the v0.1 Walking Skeleton.

See [Issues](https://github.com/mikelane/dioxide/issues) and [Milestones](https://github.com/mikelane/dioxide/milestones) for current progress.

## Vision

Traditional Python DI frameworks like `dependency-injector` are feature-rich but can be slow with large dependency graphs. `dioxide` aims to provide:

1. **Fast graph construction** using Rust's `petgraph`
2. **Type-based resolution** via Python's `__annotations__`
3. **Lifecycle management** with proper shutdown ordering
4. **Clear error messages** for missing dependencies and cycles

## Quick Start (Planned API)

```python
from dioxide import Container, Scope, component

@component(scope=Scope.SINGLETON)
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):
        self.connection_string = connection_string

@component(scope=Scope.SINGLETON)
class UserRepository:
    def __init__(self, db: DatabaseConnection):
        self.db = db

# Create container and register components
container = Container()
container.register_value('connection_string', 'postgresql://localhost/mydb')
container.register(DatabaseConnection)
container.register(UserRepository)

# Resolve dependencies
repo = container.resolve(UserRepository)
# repo.db is automatically injected

# Clean shutdown
container.shutdown()
```

## Features

### v0.1 Walking Skeleton (In Progress)
- [x] Basic project structure
- [ ] Type-based dependency resolution
- [ ] Singleton and factory scopes
- [ ] Value injection by parameter name
- [ ] Duplicate registration prevention
- [ ] Clear error messages

### v0.2 Core Features (Planned)
- [ ] Named tokens for disambiguation
- [ ] Circular dependency detection
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with reverse ordering
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- [ ] Mutation testing with `mutmut`

### Future Enhancements (Backlog)
- [ ] Conditional registration
- [ ] Provider functions
- [ ] Property injection
- [ ] Performance benchmarks vs. `dependency-injector`
- [ ] Documentation site

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Rust 1.70+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management
- [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) for building Rust extensions

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mikelane/dioxide.git
cd dioxide

# Install dependencies with uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build the Rust extension
maturin develop

# Run tests
pytest

# Run all quality checks
tox
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Format code
tox -e format

# Lint
tox -e lint

# Type check
tox -e type

# Run tests for all Python versions
tox

# Run tests with coverage
tox -e cov

# Mutation testing
tox -e mutate
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Rust for graph operations** - Dependency graphs can get complex; Rust's performance and safety help scale
2. **Python-first API** - Developers work in pure Python; Rust is an implementation detail
3. **Type hints as the contract** - Leverage Python's type system for DI metadata
4. **Explicit over implicit** - Registration is manual to avoid surprises
5. **Test-driven development** - Every feature starts with failing tests
